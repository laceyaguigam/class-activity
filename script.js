// Tonight you will be demonstrating your ability to work with expressions, statements, and variables. Create an HTML page and link an external JavaScript file to it. Inside the JavaScript file:

// Define a variable “myGreeting” and place a string containing a generic greeting inside it.
// Output the contents of “myGreeting” using console.log(...).
// Define a constant variable “pi” and place a number containing the value for Pi inside of it.
// Attempt to re-assign “pi” to something else - what happens? Why?
// Define a new variable “myNumber” and place a number of your choice inside it.
// Call the “min” function inside of the “Math” object on both “myNumber” and “pi” - what is the result? Why?
